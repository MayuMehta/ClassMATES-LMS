      <h2>Welcome to <spam class="text-danger">Class</spam><span class="text-warning">MATES</span></h2>
      <div >
        <p>A <spam class="text-danger">Class</spam><span class="text-warning">MATES</span> is a software application for the administration, documentation, 
          tracking, reporting, automation, and delivery of educational courses, training programs, materials or 
          learning and development programs. The ClassMATES concept emerged directly from e-Learning. 
          ClassMATES make up the largest segment of the learning system market. </p>
        <p>ClassMATES were designed to identify training and learning gaps, using analytical data 
          and reporting. ClassMATES are focused on online learning delivery but support a range of uses, acting as a 
          platform for online content, including courses, both asynchronous based and synchronous based. 
          In the higher education space, an ClassMATES may offer classroom management for instructor-led training or a 
          flipped classroom. Modern ClassMATES include intelligent algorithms to make automated recommendations for 
          courses based on a user's skill profile as well as extract metadata from learning materials 
          to make such recommendations even more accurate.</p>
          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            An <spam class="text-danger">Class</spam><span class="text-warning">MATES</span>  delivers and 
            manages all types of content, including videos, courses, workshops, and documents. In the education 
            and higher education markets, an ClassMATES will include a variety of functionality that is similar to 
            corporate but will have features such as rubrics, teacher and instructor-facilitated learning,
             a discussion board, and often the use of a syllabus. A syllabus is rarely a feature in the corporate LMS, 
            although courses may start with a heading-level index to give learners an overview of topics covered.
